Hello! And thank you for installing my Pong game. In order to run the program, open it up in an IDE of your choice and run the Pong.java file. The rules are quite simple:

W- Move the red paddle up
S- Move the red paddle down
UP ARROW- Move the Blue panel up
DOWN ARROW- Move the Blue panel down

First to 5 wins!
