Thanks for downloading my Rocket Landing game!

This game simulates a rocket falling from the top of the atmosphere until it reaches the ground. Your job is to ensure the Rocket reaches the ground safely.
In order for the rocket to reach the ground safely. You must control its speed using the given fuel and in the top left corner and make sure the rocket lands facing the sky. If the
rocket's nose is not facing the sky, it will crash. You must also be wary of several astroids floating about the atmosphere. The controls are listed below:

Up Arrow: Thrust the direction it is facing.
Left Arrow: Turn the rocket to the left.
Right Arrow: Turn the rocket to the right.

Do not hold the arrows, as it will burn fuel quickly. Simply click the arrows as needed. You only hae 40 gallons worth of fuel and each turn and thrust burns one Gallon.

Good luck!
